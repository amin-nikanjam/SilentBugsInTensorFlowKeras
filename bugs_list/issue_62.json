TF 2.0: `python -c \"import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the current behavior**\r\n\r\nReduceLR will execute the part of the code that reduces LR even if lr \"equals\" min_lr. While this is not a problem if we are just dealing with LR since the value will technically never go below min_lr, it is an issue if you are trying to do any other execution in this block of code (ie. weight decay).\r\n\r\nGiven that there is a min check for this block of code, i assume it was not intended for us to enter this block of code if min_lr has already been achieved. Either get rid of the min check if we don't care about re-executing this code for no reason, or make sure this block of code is not executed if lr is at min-lr.\r\n\r\nThis issue clearly seems to be a round/precision related issue where \r\nwe set our lr `K.set_value(self.model.optimizer.lr, new_lr)`\r\n\r\nBut then next iteration we fetch the lr\r\n`old_lr = float(K.get_value(self.model.optimizer.lr))`\r\n\r\nand get a slightly different value so that \r\n`if old_lr > self.min_lr:`\r\n\r\ndoes not work.\r\n\r\nSo yes in a way this does not affect default code, and it only matter if we do custom code, but i still think this is a bug that really shouldn't happen.\r\n\r\n**Describe the expected behavior**\r\n\r\nCode block that is only supposed to execute if lr does not equal min_lr does not execute if lr equals min_lr\r\n\r\n**Standalone code to reproduce the issue**\r\nProvide a reproducible test case that is the bare minimum necessary to generate\r\nthe problem. If possible, please share a link to Colab/Jupyter/any notebook.\r\n\r\n```\r\nx = np.random.normal(size=10)\r\ny = np.random.normal(size=10)\r\n\r\nmodel = Sequential()\r\nmodel.add(Dense(1))\r\n\r\nreduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='loss',\r\n                              min_delta=0.01,\r\n                              patience=3,\r\n                              min_lr=0.001,\r\n                              verbose=2)\r\n\r\nmodel.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=SGD(0.01))\r\n\r\nhistory = model.fit(x,\r\n                    y,\r\n                    epochs=25,\r\n                    verbose=2,\r\n                    shuffle=True,\r\n                    batch_size=1,\r\n                    callbacks=[reduce_lr])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Other info / logs** Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to\r\ndiagnose the problem.
